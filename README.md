# Immersive Airports

**Immersive Airports** is a comprehensive Minecraft mod that introduces realistic air traffic control systems and modular airport infrastructure. Designed to integrate seamlessly with third-party aircraft mods such as **Immersive Aircraft**, this mod allows players to build and operate realistic airports with functional ATC, radar, and navigation systems.

While **Immersive Airports** does not simulate aircraft itself, it provides the systems, blocks, and environment to support immersive aviation experiences in Minecraft.

> **Note:** Immersive Airports **must be installed on both the Minecraft server and client**.
> Clients **without the mod will not be able to connect** due to custom blocks and items introduced by the mod.

## Features

* **Realistic ATC Simulation**

  * Provides authentic ATC operations including tower, ground, and approach control roles.
  * Supports structured pilot-to-ATC interactions and radio frequency simulation.
  * Integrates with **Simple Voice Chat** for natural voice communication.

  * Adds functional runway and taxiway lighting systems with time-of-day and weather responsiveness.

* **Weather-Aware Systems**

  * ATC tools and radar dynamically respond to in-game weather (e.g., fog, storms), requiring pilots and controllers to adapt accordingly.

* **Multiplayer Aviation Coordination**

  * Enables multiple players to act as pilots or air traffic controllers across player-built airports.
  * Encourages shared airspace, IFR/VFR coordination, and full airport operations.

* **Third-Party Mod Integration**

  * Works seamlessly with flight mods like **Immersive Aircraft** and other vehicle mods.
  * Focuses on realistic infrastructure and communication rather than implementing aircraft directly.

* **Designed for Fabric**
  Built natively for the Fabric modding ecosystem for high performance and wide compatibility.
