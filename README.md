# Crafty FSD

**Crafty FSD** is a Flight Simulator Daemon for Minecraft that enables realistic communication between pilots and air traffic controllers (ATC) within the game.

It implements the Flight Simulator Protocol (FSP), commonly used by networks such as VATSIM and IVAO, but operates independently of any third-party services.

> **Note:** Crafty FSD must be installed on both the Minecraft **server** and **client**.  
> However, clients without Crafty FSD installed can still connect and play normally.

## Features

- **Realistic ATC Communication**  
  Simulates authentic pilot-to-pilot and pilot-to-ATC interactions using standard flight sim protocols.

- **Weather-Aware Integration**  
  Reflects Minecraft’s in-game weather (e.g., rain, fog) in ATC and pilot communications for enhanced realism.

- **Multiplayer Support**  
  Enables multiple pilots to fly together in the same world, with ATC managing communication and coordination.

- **No External Dependencies**  
  Unlike traditional FSDs, Crafty FSD runs entirely within Minecraft—no separate software or plugins required.

- **Designed for Fabric**  
  Developed specifically for the Fabric modding platform, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of Fabric mods.

- **Sinytra Connector Compatible**  
  Fully compatible with Sinytra Connector, allowing integration with NeoForge-based mods.
