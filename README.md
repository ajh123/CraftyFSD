# Crafty FSD

**Crafty FSD** is a Flight Simulator Daemon for Minecraft that enables realistic communication between pilots and air traffic controllers (ATC) within the game.

It implements the Flight Simulator Protocol (FSP), commonly used by networks such as VATSIM and IVAO, but operates independently of any third-party services.

> **Note:** Crafty FSD must be installed on both the Minecraft **server** and **client**.
> However, clients that do not have Crafty FSD installed can still connect to the server and play normally.

## Features

- **Realistic ATC Communication**  
  Simulates authentic pilot-to-pilot and pilot-to-ATC interactions using standard flight sim protocols.

- **Weather-Aware Integration**  
  Integrates with Minecraftâ€™s existing weather system, allowing ATC and pilot interactions to reflect current in-game conditions such as rain or fog.

- **Multiplayer Support**  
  Allows multiple pilots to fly in the same Minecraft world with centralized ATC coordination.

- **No External Dependencies**  
  Unlike traditional FSDs, Crafty FSD runs entirely within Minecraft. No additional software or plugins are required outside the game.
